title: REQ-014: Tauri Test Coverage
needs: [N-008]
---

# Description

Tauri integration tests shall be part of the continuous delivery workflow and must also run locally through the standard Tauri test command to guarantee that desktop capabilities remain stable before code reaches CI. Each acceptance criterion defined for the product must be validated by at least one mocked Tauri test so that both local runs and CI remain deterministic and independent of live LLM or shell integrations.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A GitHub Actions workflow executes the Tauri test suite on every push and pull request targeting the `main` branch.
- [ ] All Tauri tests use mocked LLM and shell interactions, following the guidance from https://v2.tauri.app/develop/tests/mocking/ to avoid real network or system side effects during CI.
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion in the requirements catalog is traceable to a dedicated Tauri test case (e.g., via test names or metadata referencing `REQ-###` and the specific checkbox).
- [ ] The mocked Tauri test suite can be executed locally via a documented command (e.g., `yarn tauri test`) that mirrors the CI workflow so developers run the same checks before pushing.
- [ ] The repository documents how to run the mocked Tauri tests locally and in CI (command, environment variables, and mocking setup) so contributors can reproduce pipeline results.
