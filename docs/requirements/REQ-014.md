title: REQ-014: Wails Test Coverage
needs: [N-008]
---

# Description

Wails-aligned tests (Go unit/integration) and Playwright E2E tests shall be part of the continuous delivery workflow and must also run locally to guarantee that desktop capabilities remain stable before code reaches CI. Each acceptance criterion must map to at least one Playwright test case; provider interactions are mocked in CI to ensure determinism and independence from live LLM or shell integrations.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A GitHub Actions workflow executes Go tests and Playwright tests on every push and pull request targeting the `main` branch.
- [ ] CI uses mocked LLM and shell interactions to avoid real network or system side effects.
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion in the requirements catalog maps to a dedicated Playwright test case (e.g., via test names or metadata referencing `REQ-###` and the specific checkbox).
- [ ] The test suites can be executed locally via documented commands (`go test ./...`, `npx playwright test`) that mirror the CI workflow.
- [ ] The repository documents how to run the tests locally and in CI (commands, environment variables, and mocking setup) so contributors can reproduce pipeline results.
