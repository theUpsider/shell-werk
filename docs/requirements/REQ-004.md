# Description

The application shall allow the user to enable a "Chat Only" mode. In this mode, the LLM is restricted to dialogue only, and no tool execution (such as shell commands) is permitted. Chat-only takes precedence over all tool-related settings and per-chat toggles.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The user can toggle "Chat Only" mode on or off.
- [ ] When "Chat Only" mode is enabled, the LLM does not execute any tools.
- [ ] When "Chat Only" mode is enabled, the LLM does not execute shell commands.
- [ ] Chat-only overrides per-tool toggles and auto-execute settings.
- [ ] The application strictly enforces a dialogue-only interaction in this mode.
