title: REQ-015: Delete Chat With Confirmation
needs: [N-001]
---

# Description

The application shall allow users to delete a chat from the sidebar via a small delete control (e.g., an icon or button) on each chat item. Clicking this control opens a confirmation dialog. Only after confirming is the chat removed from the sidebar and from persisted storage.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each chat item in the sidebar provides a dedicated delete control that does not change the active chat when clicked.
- [ ] Clicking the delete control opens a modal confirmation dialog without navigating away.
- [ ] The confirmation dialog displays the chat title and clearly warns that deletion is permanent.
- [ ] The dialog provides two actions: "Delete" (primary/destructive) and "Cancel".
- [ ] Choosing "Cancel" closes the dialog and makes no changes.
- [ ] Choosing "Delete" removes the chat from the list and deletes its data from persisted storage.
- [ ] If the deleted chat is currently active, the app selects the next most recently updated chat; if none remain, it creates and selects a new empty chat session.
- [ ] The dialog supports keyboard accessibility: focus remains within the dialog while open, and pressing Escape closes the dialog (equivalent to cancel).
