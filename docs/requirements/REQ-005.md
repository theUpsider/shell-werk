title: REQ-005: Safe Shell Execution
needs: [N-003]
---

# Description

The application shall support safe shell execution by allowing the LLM to generate shell commands. To ensure security, the shell execution tool/function must sanitize inputs and require explicit user confirmation before executing any command, unless an override is active. Dangerous commands are defined as operations targeting the OS root directory or other system-critical directories and are blocked by default. If Chat Only mode is enabled, shell execution is disabled regardless of other settings.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The LLM can generate shell commands appropriate for the user's operating system.
- [ ] The application sanitizes shell command inputs to prevent injection or dangerous execution.
- [ ] The application presents the generated shell command to the user for review.
- [ ] The user must explicitly confirm the execution of the shell command.
- [ ] The command is executed only after user confirmation (unless auto-execute is enabled).
- [ ] Commands that target the OS root or system-critical directories are blocked.
- [ ] When Chat Only mode is enabled, no shell commands are executed.
