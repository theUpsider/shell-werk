title: REQ-005: Safe Shell Execution
needs: [N-003]
---

# Description

The application shall support safe shell execution by allowing the LLM to generate shell commands. However, to ensure security, the shell exection tool / function must sanitize inputs and require explicit user confirmation before executing any command, unless an override is active.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The LLM can generate shell commands appropriate for the user's operating system.
- [ ] The application sanitizes shell command inputs to prevent injection or dangerous execution.
- [ ] The application presents the generated shell command to the user for review.
- [ ] The user must explicitly confirm the execution of the shell command.
- [ ] The command is executed only after user confirmation (unless auto-execute is enabled).
