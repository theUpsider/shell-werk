# Description

The chat interface must visually differentiate between different types of messages: user messages, LLM responses, and tool outputs. Additionally, the application must provide visual feedback while the LLM is processing ("thinking"), including a timer and a distinct visual style.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User messages are visually distinct from LLM messages (e.g., alignment, color, or label).
- [ ] LLM messages are visually distinct from user messages.
- [ ] Tool outputs are visually distinct from both user and LLM messages.
- [ ] While the LLM is generating a response, a "thinking" indicator is displayed.
- [ ] The thinking indicator includes an idea bulb icon.
- [ ] The thinking indicator includes a counter showing the elapsed time since the request started.
- [ ] The "thinking" text or content is displayed in a visually different style (e.g., paler text) compared to the final response.
- [ ] Upon completion of the thinking process, the "thoughts" are collapsed or hidden.
- [ ] The final message or tool execution result is displayed after the thinking phase is complete.
