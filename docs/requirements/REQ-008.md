# Description

The Go unit/integration and E2E tests must be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Tests run on every push and pull request using GitHub Actions. The project README displays a badge indicating the current test status. CI uses mocked LLM providers.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run Go tests and E2E tests.
- [ ] The workflow triggers on every push to the "main" branch and on pull requests.
- [ ] The README.md file includes a badge showing the current status of the test run.
- [ ] CI uses mocked LLM providers (no real Ollama/vLLM required).
