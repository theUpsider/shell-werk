title: REQ-007: E2E Testing Infrastructure (Playwright)
needs: [N-004, N-008]
---

# Description

The application shall be tested using Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) testing. The testing strategy requires a strict mapping where one test case (test / it block) corresponds to one checkbox in a requirement's acceptance criteria. One describe block maps to one requirement. E2E tests use mocked LLM providers in CI; locally, developers may optionally use real providers.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Playwright is configured as the E2E testing framework.
- [x] All E2E tests are located in the "e2e" folder.
- [x] Each test case (test / it block) maps 1:1 to a requirement acceptance criteria checkbox.
- [x] One describe block maps to one requirement.
- [x] All application functionality is covered by these E2E tests.
- [x] CI uses mocked LLM providers; no real Ollama/vLLM servers are required.
- [x] Local runs may opt into real providers via an environment flag.
