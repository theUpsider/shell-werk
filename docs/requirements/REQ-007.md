title: REQ-007: E2E Testing Infrastructure
needs: [N-004]
---

# Description

The application shall be tested using Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) testing. The testing strategy requires a strict mapping where one test case (test / it block) corresponds to one checkbox in a requirement's acceptance criteria. One describe block maps to one requirement. Tests must use a local Ollama model (qwen3:4b). Tests on CI/CD integration must not use ollama but mocks instead.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Playwright is configured as the E2E testing framework.
- [ ] All E2E tests are located in the "e2e" folder.
- [ ] Each test case (test / it block) maps 1:1 to a requirement acceptance criteria checkbox.
- [ ] One describe block maps to one requirement.
- [ ] The test environment is configured to use a local Ollama model (qwen3:4b).
- [ ] All application functionality is covered by these E2E tests.
- [ ] Tests on CI/CD integration use mocks instead of the Ollama model.
