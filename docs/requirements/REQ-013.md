title: REQ-013: Dialogue Feedback Loop
needs: [N-007]
---

# Description

The application shall implement a dialogue feedback loop that orchestrates the interaction between the user, the AI, and the tools. This loop starts with the user's message and continues through AI planning, tool execution, and result feedback until a final answer is provided. Multiple tool calls per turn are supported. Partial tool-call progress is shown as an extra card in the chat log. The loop stops when the AI calls the tool "request_fullfilled" or when a per-request timeout of 120 seconds is reached.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The feedback loop is initiated when the user sends a message.
- [x] The AI plans an action based on the user's input.
- [x] If the AI outputs a tool call, the application parses and executes the tool.
- [x] The output of the tool execution is returned to the AI.
- [x] The AI uses the tool output to plan the next action.
- [x] Multiple tool calls per turn are supported.
- [x] Partial tool-call progress is rendered as an extra card in the chat log.
- [x] The loop stops when the AI calls the tool "request_fullfilled".
- [x] The loop stops if a per-request timeout of 120 seconds is reached.
