# Description

When new tools are added / implemented by the developer and given to the LLM as available tools, the developer should be able to mark a tool as ui visible. in this case it becomes toggleable in the chat interface in the input bar area. This way the user can enable / disable certain tools for his chat session.
The developer can also provide a short description of the tool that is shown as a tooltip when hovering over the toggle button in the chat interface.
If a developer does not specifiy his tool as ui visible, it is enabled by default and given to the LLM in the list.
