title: N-006: Tool visibility toggling in chat interface
---

# Description

When new tools are added and given to the LLM as available tools, the developer can mark a tool as UI-visible. In this case it becomes toggleable in the chat interface in the input bar area so the user can enable/disable it for the session. The developer can also provide a short description shown as a tooltip when hovering over the toggle. If a developer does not specify a tool as UI-visible, it is hidden but enabled by default and still provided to the LLM. A global settings page allows disabling non-visible tools.
