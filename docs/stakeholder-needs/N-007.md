title: N-007: Dialogue feedback loop
---

# Description

The dialogue starts when the user sends the first message. A feedback loop is initiated where the AI plans an action, emits a tool call, the app parses and calls the tool, returns the tool output to the AI, and the AI plans the next action until the final answer is reached. Multiple tool calls per turn are supported. Partial tool-call progress is shown as an extra card in the chat log. The loop stops when the AI calls the tool "request_fullfilled" or when a per-request timeout of 120 seconds is reached.
