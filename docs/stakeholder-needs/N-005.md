title: N-005: LLM selection in chat interface
---

# Description

The chat interface allows selecting from a list of available LLMs. The list is retrieved from app settings. The application must support vLLM as well as Ollama. The selected LLM is a global app default used for all new chats and is preselected on launch. The selection and provider configuration are persisted across app restarts. Settings are available via a settings button that opens a modal.
