title: N-001: User chat interface
---

# Description

The user interacts with the application via a chat interface. The interface has a chat in the middle with an input bar at the bottom, similar to ChatGPT and Ollama.
The app has a sidebar on the left of past chats. When the user selects a past chat, the chat history is loaded into the chat interface.
The chat differantiates between user messages, LLM messages, and tool outputs visually. While the model is thinking, the thinking is streamed to the chat interface and displayed with a idea bulb icon, a counter for how long it has been thinking and visually different text (more pale). After the thinking is done, the thoughts are collapsed and the final message is shown or tool executed.
The input bar has a text input field as well as a send button. The user can also press enter to send the message. The chat is scrollable and autoscrolls to the bottom when new messages arrive.
The user can start a new chat via a button in the sidebar. The new chat starts with an empty chat history.
