title: N-003: Safe shell execution
---

# Description

The app supports safe shell execution. The LLM knows which OS the user is on and can generate shell commands using the tool functions provided to the LLM. The shell tool functinon sanitizes inputs to avoid dangerous commands. The user has to confirm any shell command before execution. He may choose to enable "auto execute" for a single chat sesstion. Then the app directly executes the shell command without asking for confirmation.
The "auto execute" mode can be activated by enabling a checkbox under the first tool call in a chat session.
