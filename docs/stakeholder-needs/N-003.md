title: N-003: Safe shell execution
---

# Description

The app supports safe shell execution. The LLM knows which OS the user is on and can generate shell commands using the tool functions provided to the LLM. The shell tool function sanitizes inputs to avoid dangerous commands. Dangerous commands are defined as operations targeting the OS root directory or other system-critical directories; these are blocked by default. The user must confirm any shell command before execution. They may choose to enable "auto execute" for a single chat session. Then the app directly executes the shell command without asking for confirmation. If chat-only mode is enabled, shell execution is disabled regardless of other settings.
The "auto execute" mode can be activated by enabling a checkbox under the first tool call in a chat session.
