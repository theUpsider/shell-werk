title: N-004: End-to-end testing with Playwright
---

# Description

All functionality is tested and works as the requirements expect them. The stakeholder explicitly request using playwright for e2e tests as the only way of testing. ONE test case (describe) maps to ONE checkbox on a requirement acceptance criteria list. For the tests, ollama needs to serve a small local model (qwen3:4b) beforehand.
All tests are located in the "e2e" folder. The tests need to be run in github actions on every push to main. The readme also has a badge showing the current test status.
