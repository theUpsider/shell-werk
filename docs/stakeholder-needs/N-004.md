title: N-004: End-to-end testing with Playwright
---

## Description

All functionality is tested and works as the requirements expect them. ONE test case (test / it block) maps to ONE checkbox on a requirement acceptance criteria list. One describe maps to one requirement. For CI/CD, LLM interactions are mocked; local runs may opt into real providers via an environment flag.
All tests are located in the "e2e" folder. The tests need to be run in github actions on every push to main. The readme also has a badge showing the current test status.
