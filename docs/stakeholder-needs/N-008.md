title: N-006: Tauri tests
---

# Description

Tauri tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, and the same mocked suite must be runnable locally through the standard Tauri test command so contributors can verify changes before opening PRs. Tests map to one acceptance criteria checkbox per requirement. Mocks are used instead of actual LLM calls during CI/CD testing (and local runs) to ensure reliability and speed. Consult: https://v2.tauri.app/develop/tests/mocking/ for guidance on mocking in Tauri tests. Also use context7 for reference.
