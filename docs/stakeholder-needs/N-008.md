title: N-008: Wails testing
---

# Description

Testing is aligned with Wails (Go backend + React frontend) and runs consistently on Windows and Linux.

- Go unit and integration tests execute with `go test ./...`, mocking all external services (LLM providers, shell, filesystem side-effects) for determinism.
- End-to-end tests are implemented with Playwright in the `e2e/` folder. One `describe` maps to one requirement, and a single test case maps to one acceptance criteria checkbox.
- LLM interactions are mocked in CI and by default for local runs; no Ollama or vLLM servers are used in CI. Developers may opt-in to real providers locally via an environment flag.
- CI (GitHub Actions) runs Go tests and Playwright e2e on every push to `main` and on PRs. The README contains a badge showing the current CI status.
- E2E flows cover tool-calling, including multiple tool calls per turn and partial tool-call progress rendered as an extra card in the chat log. Per-request timeouts are 120 seconds, matching dialogue loop stop conditions.
